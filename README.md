# Data Visualization
The graphical representation of information in the form of a chart, diagram, picture, etc. 
# Types of Data Visualization
## Information Visualization

The term information visualization is generally applied to the visual representation of large-scale collections of non-numerical information, such as files and lines of code in software systems, library and bibliographic databases, networks of relations on the internet, and so forth.
Its covering most statistical charts and graphs but also other visual/spatial metaphors that can be used to represent data sets that don't have inherent spatial components.

# Process of Visualization
## Phase 1: What to visualize
    Inputs: Visualization Goals (What do we want to show?)
            Visualization Needs (Who is consuming this data?)
            Visualization Shape (What data dimensions do we have to play with?)
    Spec:   Select data to include


## Phase 2: How to visualize
    - Select axis for your most important data & relationship
    - Consider & apply encodings for all other data dimensions
    - Experiment, iterate, etc.


Visualization Goals:
    What questions are we trying to answer
    What decisions are you trying to enable
    ## Data has properties
    What types of data do you have? 
        1. categorical (grouped)
        2. ordinal (ranked, time)
        3. quantitative (numeric)
        4. relational (hierarchy, influence, etc.) 4.5. location (... it’s complicated...)

## Design Strategies
- Limit the data & detail you include
- Use position for your most important relationship(s)
- Try different axes
- Consider default formats
- Use color for categories, not rank
- Encode other data and relationships with appropriate properties • Iterate, iterate, iterate
